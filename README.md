## Brief description:

The focus idea of this project is to design and implement an accommodation system which enables Hall Managers and Wardens to schedule hall activities and keep track of room status and student leases. The design of Class diagrams allows us to recognise a clear structure of the system, what data types are to be stored as, and what classes need to be implemented. Furthermore, a UseCase diagram will present a logical run-through of the system, where it explains each actor has different levels of access within the system.

With completion of the system, error testing and final checks have been made. We assessed each individual class for signs of system crash or errors, and have come to the conclusion that the application is in-line with the specification; therefore completed.
