Brief description

The focus idea of this project is to design and implement a accommodation system which enables Hall manager and Wardens to schedule hall activities and keep track of room status of student leases. The design of Class diagrams allows us to recognize a clear structure of the system of what data types to be stored as and what classes needs to be implemented. Furthermore, UseCase diagram will present a logical run-through of the system, where it explains each actor has different level of privileges within the system.

With completion of the system, error testing and final checks have been made. We assessed each individual class for signs of system crash or errors; we came to the conclusion where no further errors have been found.
